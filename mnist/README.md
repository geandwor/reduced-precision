training the mnist data set

compare the parameter and changes in the involved values in bf16 and float 32 bits.

running environment:

python 3.6

tensorflow 1.8.0


trained_mnist.py -- simple network and convoluted network in float16


trained_mnist.py -- simple network and convoluted network in bfloat 16

trained_mnist.py -- simple network and convoluted network in float32


trained_mnistcomparebf16fl32 -- simple network and convoluted network in both bfloat16 and float32 				     --	and compare the difference in the intermediary value in the 				     --	learning progress
